# Germline and Somatic Variant Analysis Tutorial

This repository contains educational materials for MSc students at the **UCD School of Medicine**, focused on **germline and somatic DNA variant analysis** using real-world examples and open-source tools.

## 🔬 Purpose

The goal of this tutorial is to help students:

- Understand the principles of germline vs somatic variant calling.
- Learn how to interpret variants using annotation tools like **VEP** and databases like **ClinVar**, **gnomAD**, and **COSMIC**.
- Explore MAF (Mutation Annotation Format) files using **maftools**.
- Gain practical skills in cancer genomics and inherited disease variant interpretation.

## 📁 Contents

- `data/`: Example input files (MAF, VCF, TSV).
- `scripts/`: Bash and R scripts for variant calling and filtering.
- `tutorials/`: R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files for interactive analysis in RStudio.
- `results/`: Output and plots generated during the analysis.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek): For germline and somatic variant calling.
- [VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html): For functional annotation.
- [maftools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maftools.html): For visualization and downstream mutation analysis.

## 📘 Topics Covered

- Germline vs somatic variant pipelines
- Variant filtering and interpretation
- Cancer-related mutation patterns
- Survival analysis using annotated MAF files

## 👩‍🎓 For Students

This tutorial is intended as a **learning resource** for students participating in modules related to **clinical genomics**, **bioinformatics**, or **molecular pathology**. It includes hands-on exercises, pre-annotated files, and code snippets to support self-paced learning.
